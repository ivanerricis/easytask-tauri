# Architecture

A short tour of how EasyTask is built, for someone who wants to change the code.

## Tech stack

- [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app/): Rust backend, SQLite through `tauri-plugin-sql`.
- [React 19](https://react.dev/) and TypeScript, built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (Radix UI).
- [@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) for drag and drop.
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) with react-i18next for translations.
- Vitest and Testing Library for unit tests; WebdriverIO with `tauri-driver` for end-to-end tests.

## Folder layout

| Folder | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `src/pages` | The two screens: `mainPage` (home) and `workspacePage` |
| `src/components` | Shared components; `ui/` holds the shadcn/ui ones, `dialogs/` the dialogs |
| `src/contexts` | React contexts for workspace data, tabs, preferences, shortcuts, audio, automations and undo |
| `src/hooks` | Reusable hooks (for example `useItemMutations`, `useAfterMenuClose`) |
| `src/db` | SQLite access: connection, schema, migrations, queries, backups |
| `src/lib` | Plain logic: preferences store, automations engine, updater, colors, shortcuts, workspace import and export. `lib/tabs` holds the pure tab and layout reducers, with no dependency on contexts |
| `src/i18n` | i18next setup and the `it` and `en` locale files |
| `src-tauri/src` | The Rust backend (`lib.rs`, `media_session.rs`) |
| `src-tauri/capabilities` | Permissions granted to the frontend |
| `e2e` | End-to-end specs, UI tour and docs screenshots |
| `scripts` | Version bump and check scripts |

Tests sit next to the code they test, as `*.test.ts(x)`.

## Data flow

The frontend talks to SQLite directly. `src/db/dbManager.ts` opens the database with `Database.load` from `tauri-plugin-sql`, and the functions in `src/db/queries/` run the SQL (one file per entity: workspace, folder, note, group, section, task, template, automation and so on; `transfer/` splits workspace export, validation and import).

The contexts in `src/contexts` call those queries and keep the data in React state. Many changes are applied to the state first and rolled back if the query fails (`with-rollback.ts`, `note-optimistic.ts`). Deletes go to the trash first and keep their ids.

The workspace version counters (tree, trash, templates and so on) live in an external store, not in React state: components read one with `useWorkspaceVersion(kind)`, so tree consumers do not re-render when another counter changes.

Small shared helpers avoid repeated boilerplate: `createRequiredContextHook` (the `useX` hook of a context that throws outside its provider), `createEmitter` and `createWindowEvent` (typed events), `useOpenList` (dialogs that load a list when opened), `useStoredSwitch` (a settings switch backed by a preference), `useNewTaskField` (the new task input) and `useItemMutations` / `useAfterMenuClose` (item actions and menus).

The Rust side handles what the browser cannot do: it decides the data folder, runs several SQL statements in one transaction, reads media keys, and sets up the plugins, tray and updater.

## Data folder

The backend picks the data folder in this order:

1. `EASYTASK_DATA_DIR`, if set.
2. A `data` folder next to the executable, if a `portable.txt` file sits next to it (portable mode).
3. `Documents/EasyTask`.

## Migrations

`src/db/initDb.ts` applies the migrations in order and tracks them with `PRAGMA user_version`. The first migration creates the whole schema (`src/db/schema/initial.ts`): the older migrations were squashed into it.

Rules for a new migration: append it, never edit one that was already applied, and keep it idempotent and additive. A database with a higher version than the app knows is refused as newer, and a safety copy is taken before migrating an existing database. Version 12 adds partial indexes on the trashed and archived rows.

## Settings

Preferences and shortcuts are saved with `tauri-plugin-store` in `settings.dat`, inside the data folder (`src/lib/store`). Writes are debounced (`save-soon.ts`). The open tabs (the layout of the two areas, see below) and the last workspace are kept in the same store.

## Split workspace

The workspace can be split in two side-by-side areas (panes), each with its own tabs and active note.

- `src/lib/tabs/layout-reducer.ts` holds `LayoutState { left, right, focused }` (`right` is `null` when not split) and wraps the per-pane `tabsReducer` (`src/lib/tabs/tabs-reducer.ts`). Both are pure; `src/contexts/layout-reducer.ts` and `tabs-reducer.ts` just re-export them. Moving a tab between panes is one atomic action.
- `TabsProvider` (`tabs-context.tsx`) is built from smaller pieces: `use-layout-persistence` (save and restore), `use-tab-stores` and `tab-ui-store` (external stores), `use-tabs-values` (the context values) and `tabs-providers.tsx` (the nested providers).
- `TabsProvider` exposes the usual hooks (`useTabs`, `useActiveNote`) for the focused pane: `activeId` and `currentNote` are the focused pane's, while `openIds` and `tabs` are the union of both panes. `PaneProvider` (`src/contexts/pane-provider.tsx`) overrides the tabs and active-note contexts with the values of one pane, so the components inside a pane work as if there was a single note.
- `ActiveNoteProvider` loads the notes of both panes and keeps three instances of the optimistic actions: the focused pane, the left one and the right one.
- One note is open in at most one pane. Opening a note already open in the other pane activates it there.
- A single `TabsDndProvider` wraps both tab bars, so a tab can be dragged from one to the other.
- Handlers registered by `useShortcut` and `useAppCommand` run only in the focused pane, so a shortcut does not fire twice.
- The layout is saved in `openTabs:<workspaceId>` as `{ version: 2, left, right, focused }`. The old `{ openIds, activeId }` shape is read as the left pane. It is restored at startup only when "reopen notes" is on.
- The pane tree keeps the same shape whether split or not, so opening or closing the split does not remount the left pane. While the divider is dragged only the `--split-ratio` CSS variable of the container is rewritten; the ratio is saved when the drag ends.

## Translations

The locale files are in `src/i18n/locales/it` and `src/i18n/locales/en`, split by area (`settings.ts`, `dialogs.ts`, `tasks.ts` and so on). The Italian files define the `Translation` type, and the English object is typed with it, so a missing key in one language is a compile error. Components read strings with `useTranslation`. The language preference is `system`, `it` or `en`.

## Undo

`src/contexts/undo` implements undo and redo. Each user action is an `UndoCommand` with a translated `label` and two functions, `undo` and `redo`, that use stable ids. The provider keeps the stacks and the actions are listed in the history.

## Tauri plugins and capabilities

The backend registers these plugins: single-instance, window-state, dialog, fs, sql, store, opener, clipboard-manager, process, log, updater and autostart.

The frontend can only call what `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` allows for the `main` window. For example, `fs` is limited to the listed operations, `opener` can only open the project's GitHub URLs, and `sql` and `store` are limited to the listed commands. If you add a feature that needs a new plugin command, add its permission there.
